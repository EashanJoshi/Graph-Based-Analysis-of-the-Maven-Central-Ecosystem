# Graph-Based Analysis of the Maven Central Ecosystem

This project investigates the structural evolution and dependency management patterns within the Maven Central repository, one of the largest ecosystems for Java libraries. By constructing a comprehensive dependency graph with over 15 million nodes and 134 million edges, we analyze growth trends, identify periods of accelerated adoption or stabilization, and explore how global factors like economic disruptions influence release and maintenance cycles. Our approach leverages graph-theoretical models and the extensible Weaver API to capture metrics such as dependency depth, library popularity, and the incidence of unmaintained packages.

The results highlight a clear long-term increase in dependency usage, demonstrating a shift toward modularization and reuse in software development practices. We observe that while dependency counts per library have grown steadily over the years, the ecosystem has also shown periods of adaptation and caution, particularly during global disruptions. These findings offer practical insights for developers and researchers aiming to improve dependency resilience, security, and sustainability in large-scale software ecosystems.
